# NBA Predictive Analytics Platform

An NBA player stat prediction tool that uses an ensemble of six machine learning models to forecast Points, Assists, and Rebounds for the day's games based on given game context and historical performance data.

## Features

- **Ensemble Predictions** — Averages predictions from Bayesian Ridge, Gradient Boost, LightGBM, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
- **Game Context Inputs** — Factors in opponent, home/away status, spread, and total
- **Automated Data Scraping** — Fetches player stats, defensive ratings, and usage rates from NBA sources (NBA.com, Basketball Reference)
- **Dark-Themed UI** — Clean Gradio interface for quick lookups

## Tech Stack

- **ML / Data**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: Gradio, Tailwind CSS
- **Data Collection**: Custom scrapers using Selenium and curl_cffi
